# Buttons-React

A React version of Buttons Lite that also leverages Webpack, CSS Modules, and Post CSS and modern CSS Variables

_Note that we omit circle, square, and box buttons to keep this code lean._

## Get started:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:unicorn-ui/Buttons-React.git
cd Buttons-React
yarn && yarn styleguide
```

## Use in your project:

As it's likely that you want to reconfigure colors, fonts, etc., our recommendation is to just drop in the `components/buttons` directory in to your project. From there, edit the values in `components/buttons/options.css` to whatever makes sense for your project.
